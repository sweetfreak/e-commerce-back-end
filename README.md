## Overview
This is the template for the back end of an E-commerce website. By using JAWSdb, Heroku, dotenv, Express, Mysql, and Sequelize, a database of products, categories, and tags can be created without having the user type in any SQL.

## Installation
- Please type in "npm i" to install all necessary packages in the package.json.
- Then type in "npm run seed" to enter all data within the db and seed folders (the schema.sql and data information will be entered into the mysql database this way)
- To begin the applications, simply type "npm start" into the terminal.
- The user can then enter get, post, put, and delete requests here to search for all products, tags, and category, including single item searches, updating items, and more.
- The database as been uploaded to heroku and uses jawsdb as a server.
